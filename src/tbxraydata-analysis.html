      <h1>Welcome to this Chest X-ray Data Analysis</h1>
      <p>I am excited to share with you a fascinating exploration into the NIH chest x-ray dataset, delve into the wealth of information hidden within medical images. This analysis aims to uncover patterns, understand patient demographics, and shed light on the presence of various medical conditions.</p>

    <!-- What We Explored Section -->
    <section id="explored">
      <h2>What Was Explored</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Insights:</strong> Started by understanding the basics of the dataset, examining patient ages, and getting an overview of the medical conditions present in the x-rays.</li>
        <li><strong>Demographic Patterns:</strong> Through visualizations, explored how age groups and gender correlate with the occurrence of medical conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow-up Analysis:</strong> Understanding the number of follow-ups required for different conditions provides valuable insights into patient care and healthcare planning.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-Condition Analysis:</strong> Investigated the co-occurrence of multiple conditions and their distribution across age groups.</li>

      <h2>Next Steps - TB Prediction Project</h2>
      <p>Ready for more excitement? I am working on a project to predict the presence of Tuberculosis (TB) in chest x-rays. Join me on this journey to leverage machine learning for early detection and improved patient outcomes.</p>
      <p>Start the TB Prediction Project <a href="https://www.daviddasa.com/tuberculosis-chestxray">here</a>.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>In conclusion, this analysis not only uncovers insights into the chest x-ray dataset but also lays the groundwork for future projects, including the TB prediction initiative. My project to develop a model to accurately predict the presence of tuberculosis in chest x-rays.</p>
      <p>Thank you for reading, and we look forward to your continued interest!</p>
