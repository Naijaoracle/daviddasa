          <h2>The elevator pitch</h2>
          <p>In 1986, David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ronald Williams published a paper with a sleep-inducing title—“Learning Representations by Back-Propagating Errors.” Under the hood was dynamite: a practical, general way to teach multi-layer neural networks by sending blame backward from the output to every connection that contributed to a mistake. With that recipe, deep models stopped being clever toys and started becoming trainable tools.</p>
          <p>If you’ve used anything from an ECG arrhythmia classifier to a note-summarizing language model, you’ve benefited from this idea. Backprop is the stethoscope of modern AI: simple in principle, endlessly useful, still essential even as the rest of the kit gets fancier.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The clinical metaphor</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The final diagnosis is the model’s output.</li>
            <li>The error is the gap between what we said and what we should have said.</li>
            <li>Feedback travels backward through the chain assigning proportional responsibility.</li>
            <li>Everyone tweaks behaviour for next time. That’s backprop.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Backprop formalizes this cascade with the chain rule: compute how much each weight nudged the final error, then nudge it the opposite way a little. Repeat, and the network improves.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>One-paragraph intuition</h2>
          <p>A neural network stacks simple units that add inputs, squash them, and pass them on. You choose a loss. Backprop efficiently answers “if I twitch this weight, how much does the loss change?” That derivative is the gradient. Move each weight against its gradient by a small step (learning rate). Do it for all weights, all examples—learning emerges.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Why it mattered</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A single backward pass computes all gradients.</li>
            <li>Hidden layers learn useful internal features without hand-coding.</li>
            <li>Demonstrated nontrivial tasks—proof that representation learning works.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What it unlocked in healthcare</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Medical imaging (U-Nets, ResNets), signals (ECG/EEG/PPG), language (transformers), and multimodal models.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Strengths and caveats</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>General-purpose, data-driven, composable.</li>
            <li>Mind the pitfalls: vanishing/exploding gradients, overfitting, shortcut learning, data drift, local explanations.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Bottom line</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Backprop is the learning engine of modern AI.</li>
            <li>Ask about loss, gradients, validation; if answers are mushy, the model is mushy.</li>
          </ul>
