        <h2>INTRO</h2>
        <p>In 1986, Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams published a paper with an unflashy promise: take the error a neural network makes at its output and flow that “blame” backward through every layer so each connection can adjust itself. That’s backpropagation. If you’ve seen a model read an ECG, outline a tumor, or draft a clinic letter, this is the learning engine underneath. Think of a ward round debrief: the consultant spots a missed diagnosis, then feedback travels back through the team—registrar, SHO, notes, triage—so each part improves next time. Backprop is that feedback cascade written in calculus. The magic isn’t mysticism; it’s bookkeeping done efficiently so the model improves with every example rather than relying on hand-crafted rules.</p>

      <!-- TLDR -->
      <section class="project-card">
        <h2>TLDR</h2>
        <p>Backpropagation turns “being wrong” into useful updates. By using the chain rule from calculus, it tells each weight in a neural network how to change to reduce future error. That let multi-layer networks learn internal concepts—edges in images, arrhythmia signatures in signals, medication negations in notes—without engineers spelling them out. Nearly all modern systems in healthcare AI, from U-Nets to transformers, still learn this way.</p>

        <h2>CONTENT</h2>
        <p>Picture a tiny network predicting DVT risk from a few inputs. It combines the inputs with different strengths, squashes the total to a value between 0 and 1, and compares that to truth. The single number that measures wrongness is the loss. Now imagine nudging one weight by a hair and asking, “Would the loss rise or fall?” That slope is the gradient. Backprop computes those slopes for every weight by passing an “error signal” backward, layer by layer. Each weight steps a little in the downhill direction. Repeat across many patients and the network starts to encode useful intermediate features—patterns you didn’t predefine but that help the task.</p>
        <p>This mattered because early neural nets could only learn shallow representations. The 1986 result gave a general recipe for multiple hidden layers, and those layers learned structure not obvious at the input. In the original paper, the network discovered family-tree relationships and symmetry rules; in clinics today, analogous layers learn vessel edges, ST-segment forms, or the habit of writing “no evidence of …” and treating that as negation. Nothing mystical: the system just keeps editing itself to make tomorrow’s error smaller than today’s.</p>
        <p>A few practical notes keep the romance honest. Deep stacks of squashing functions used to choke the gradient signal; modern activations and residual connections keep information flowing. Models happily learn shortcuts—like associating portable X-ray markers with sicker patients—so evaluation has to be broader than a shiny AUROC. External validation, subgroup checks, and drift monitoring are the bread and butter. And while gradients can be visualized to see what influenced a prediction, those pictures are guides, not proof of causality. The safest deployments pair this learning engine with workflow rules: refuse dosing, show uncertainty, cite sources, escalate when inputs look odd.</p>

      <!-- CONCLUSION -->
      <section class="project-card">
        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>Backpropagation didn’t make neural networks wise; it made them educable. That single capability—turning error into improvement—opened the door to imaging systems that contour organs, monitors that flag deteriorations earlier, and language models that draft but don’t prescribe. The clinical posture that fits this technology is straightforward: measure the right thing, let the model learn, keep humans in the loop, and watch for the usual failure modes. When someone pitches a model, ask about the loss they optimized, how gradients were monitored during training, how they prevented shortcuts, and how they’ll detect drift once the system meets real patients. If those answers are clear, you’re standing on the solid, slightly unglamorous foundation laid in 1986—and that’s exactly where safe healthcare AI belongs.</p>
