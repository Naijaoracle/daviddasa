      <h2>Understanding Your BMI</h2>
      <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple yet effective tool to assess whether your weight is within a healthy range relative to your height. Knowing your BMI can provide valuable insights into your overall health and potential risks associated with your weight.</p>
    
      <p>Here's what your BMI classification indicates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Underweight:</strong> BMI less than 18.5</li>
        <li><strong>Normal weight:</strong> BMI between 18.5 and 24.999</li>
        <li><strong>Overweight:</strong> BMI between 25 and 29.999</li>
        <li><strong>Obese:</strong> BMI 30 or greater</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>Understanding your BMI can serve as an initial assessment of your body weight and its potential impact on your health. While BMI doesn't directly measure body fat, it can be a useful screening tool. However, it's essential to note that individual health is complex, and other factors such as muscle mass and distribution may influence these classifications.</p>
    
      <p>It's advisable to consult with a healthcare professional for a comprehensive assessment of your health, taking into account various factors beyond BMI.</p>
    
      <p>Use the BMI calculator above to find your BMI and gain insights into your weight status. Remember that maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular physical activity, contributes significantly to overall well-being.</p>
