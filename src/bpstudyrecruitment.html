        <p>Blood Pressure Monitoring: Improving the Experience</p>

        <p>• Do you have high blood pressure?</p>
        <p>• Are you a healthcare professional involved in blood pressure management?</p>
        
        <p>We are seeking participants for a research study at Bournemouth University to evaluate a new technology called Lifelight for blood pressure monitoring.</p>
        
        <p>The study aims to understand:</p>
        <p>• How easy and comfortable patients find using Lifelight technology to measure blood pressure using their smartphone cameras.</p>
        <p>• Clinicians' perspectives on Lifelight's potential benefits for patients and their practice.</p>
        <p>• Management's interest in adopting Lifelight technology.</p>
        
        <p>If you are a patient:</p>
        <p>You will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire and have your blood pressure measured using both a traditional monitor and Lifelight technology.</p>
        <p>You will then share your experience using Lifelight through a short questionnaire.</p>
        
        <p>If you are a healthcare professional:</p>
        <p>You will be asked to complete a questionnaire about your experience with blood pressure monitoring technologies and your initial impressions of Lifelight.</p>
        <p>Participation is voluntary and confidential. All information will be anonymized before analysis.</p>
        
        <p>There are no known risks associated with participating, and the potential benefits include gaining a better understanding of Lifelight technology and its role in blood pressure monitoring.</p>
