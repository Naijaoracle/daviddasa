        <h2>Blood Pressure Monitoring: Improving the Experience</h2>

        <p>• Do you have high blood pressure?</p>
        <p>• Are you a healthcare professional involved in blood pressure management?</p>
        
        <p>We are seeking participants for a research study at Bournemouth University to evaluate a new technology called Lifelight for blood pressure monitoring.</p>

        <h3>The Study Aims to Understand:</h3>
        <p>• How easy and comfortable patients find using Lifelight technology to measure blood pressure using their smartphone cameras.</p>
        <p>• Clinicians' perspectives on Lifelight's potential benefits for patients and their practice.</p>
        <p>• Management's interest in adopting Lifelight technology.</p>
        
        <h3>If You Are a Patient:</h3>
        <p>You will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire and have your blood pressure measured using both a traditional monitor and Lifelight technology.</p>
        <p>You will then share your experience using Lifelight through a short questionnaire.</p>
        
        <h3>If You Are a Healthcare Professional:</h3>
        <p>You will be asked to complete a questionnaire about your experience with blood pressure monitoring technologies and your initial impressions of Lifelight.</p>
        <p>Participation is voluntary and confidential. All information will be anonymized before analysis.</p>

        <h3>Ethics and Study Information</h3>
        <p>Ethics ID Number: 55993</p>
        <p>Participant Information Sheet – Patient’s Sheet</p>
        <p><strong>Title of the Research Project:</strong> Evaluating the Effectiveness of Remote Photoplethysmography (Lifelight Technology) for Hypertension Screening in Individuals with Darker Skin Tones</p>
        <p><strong>The Researcher:</strong></p>
        <p>Name: David Dasa, an MSc Student at Bournemouth University</p>
        <p>Faculty: Science and Technology</p>
        
        <h3>Purpose of the Research/Questionnaire</h3>
        <p>Lifelight technology uses smart device cameras to analyze small changes in the color of the face as blood flows, estimating heart rate and blood pressure. This study aims to understand if Lifelight technology can be used for hypertension screening in individuals with darker skin tones and if it is acceptable as an alternative to current methods.</p>
        <p>This study and the data collection is part of my master's degree studies.</p>
        
        <p>Lifelight is an app installed on an iPad. It does not take any identifiable data but uses the reflected light from an individual's face, requiring a well-lit environment. The data collection will last for four weeks.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Have I Been Chosen?</h3>
        <p>If you have expressed interest in participating by contacting the MSc student researcher or visiting the study location, thank you for your interest! Please keep in mind the following information:</p>
        <p><strong>Inclusion Criteria:</strong> Individuals aged 18 and above.</p>
        <p><strong>Exclusion Criteria:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inability to provide consent for participation.</li>
            <li>Pregnancy – unique factors affect blood pressure in pregnancy, and the current Lifelight algorithm is not designed to capture those.</li>
            <li>Individuals with skin conditions obscuring facial features (third degree burns, psoriasis, etc.)</li>
            <li>Individuals with heavy facial makeup obscuring facial features.</li>
            <li>Individuals unable to stay still enough for forty seconds to get a Lifelight reading (e.g., static tremors).</li>
            <li>Individuals outside Fitzpatrick skin tone V and VI.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Target Sample Size:</strong> The study aims to recruit a total of 500 patient participants and 50 members of staff, based on statistical considerations to make the research robust enough to reflect the population.</p>
        
        <h3>Do I Have to Take Part?</h3>
        <p>Participation is voluntary. You can withdraw at any time without giving a reason, retaining this information sheet for your reference. If you decide to take part, simply decline to sign the participant agreement form. Once you have completed and submitted your survey responses or participated in the blood pressure measurements, we are unable to remove your anonymized data from the study.</p>
        
        <h3>How Long Will the Questionnaire and Measurement Take to Complete?</h3>
        <p>15 to 20 minutes</p>

        <h3>Advantages and Possible Disadvantages or Risks of Taking Part</h3>
        <p>Whilst there are no immediate benefits, this work aims to improve knowledge of using Lifelight technology for hypertension screening as an alternative to current methods. There are no known risks, although some people may find having their blood pressure measured with an arm cuff device uncomfortable.</p>
        
        <h3>Information Collection</h3>
        <p>We will measure your blood pressure three times using both traditional (arm cuff) OMRON monitors and Lifelight technology to compare the methods. Your skin tone will be noted using the Fitzpatrick scale to understand its influence on our accuracy. We will also note if you have facial tribal marks, as this might affect the accuracy of our measurements.</p>
        <p>You will complete a brief questionnaire about your demographics (age, sex), health information, blood pressure monitoring habits, any history of hypertension, and your experience with Lifelight technology.</p>

        <h3>Use of My Information</h3>
        <p>Participation is based on consent, and you can withdraw at any point before submitting your survey responses. We ensure your responses are secure and used only for this research study. Once submitted, it will not be possible to remove your anonymized responses from the study analysis.</p>
        <p>It will not be possible for you to be identified from this data.</p>
