      <h2>Discover Your Hearing Frequency Range</h2>
      <p>Take this test to gain valuable insights into your auditory health. Identify the specific frequencies you can hear for a better understanding of your abilities to hear across the sound spectrum.</p>
      <p>This information may help you recognize potential signs of a decline in your hearing. For the standard test done in hospital, the frequency ranges from <hard>125 Hz to 8000 Hz</hard> (low pitch to high pitch). The test also varies the volume for each frequency (from very quiet to very loud).</p>
      <p>For example, difficulty in hearing sounds around 4000 Hz could indicate noise-induced hearing loss, while a more general difficulty in hearing sounds above 2000 Hz might suggest age-related hearing loss.</p>
      <p>Being aware of these patterns allows you to monitor your hearing health and, if necessary, seek professional advice. This test empowers you with knowledge about your hearing capabilities, facilitating early awareness of potential issues and encouraging proactive steps towards maintaining optimal auditory well-being.</p>
      <p>Remember, the test results are not a substitute for professional medical advice but serve as a useful tool to prompt further discussions with healthcare providers.</p>
